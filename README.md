# Crypto Traker
Crypto Traker is an informational crypto currency web app. You can use it to compare live prices, find current news, and learn about new crypto currencies.

Visit at Https://cryptotraker.tech

The main page displays the Top 10 crypto currencies in the world and the first 12 random news articles.

Clicking show more for 10 top cryptos will take you to the cryptocurrencies page and there you can view 50+ cryptos and search for a specific one.

Clicking on a crptyo card will take you to a crypto details page with a line graph(with selectable dates), information about that crytpo, and links to varios pages including the githib for most coins.

Clicking on the a news article will open new tab and take you to that external news page. Clicking show more for the news acticles will takes you to the news page showing 50+ news actclies. On the news page you can use the search to find news acticles for a certain crypto(my favorite feature).
